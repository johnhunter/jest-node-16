# Jest with node 16

This repo was created to expose the memory issue with jest in the latest
version of node.

When using jest with node 16.11+, the memory usage can easily go out of
control even for very simple test suites like those used in this repo.

_Note: This fork uses Volta for running tests with differnent node versions. See [relevant documentation here](https://docs.volta.sh/reference/run)._

### Notes:

- Jest 29 seems to have reduced memory leaks although increasing run time.
- Node 16 has increased the leaked memory since 16.10.
- `expose-gc` allows Jest to trigger the node CG after each test. Node optimises performance by using a [large heap old-space](https://www.nearform.com/blog/tracking-memory-allocation-node-js/) - sacrificing memory use to get speed. Therefore we would expect using the `expose-gc` flag would result in a smaller heap delta but an increased run time.
